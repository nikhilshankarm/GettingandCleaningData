The R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

*-Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.*                    
*-Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.*                      
*-Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set*                                 
*-Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.*                               
*-From the data set in previous step, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.*                          

GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
